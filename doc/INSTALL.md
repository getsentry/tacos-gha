# Installation

To configure a GitHub repository to use TACOS-GHA, you need to configure a
number of workflows in the `.github/workflows/` directory in the repository.
Examples of these workflow files can be found [here](workflows).

Additionally, the [install-labels](../lib/tacos/install-labels) script can be
used to create the necessary labels that TACOS-GHA looks for.
