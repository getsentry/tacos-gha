# TODO

## Major Milestones

- [ ] wide rollout & comms
  - [ ] @buck jira ticket for bucket permissions
  - [ ] @ellison clickops quickfix test-region bucket
  - [ ] JIRA backlog to tf-import test-region bucket
- [ ] @ellison down the old terraform-plan workflow
  - after full rollout and acceptance
- [ ] drift remediation
  - [ ] allowlist config
  - [ ] ensure lock conflict message links to the lock-holding PR
    - essential for people know when there's conflicting drift
  - [ ] @buck how will people know when there's _new_ drift?
  - [ ] @buck TODO: check for the opening of the drift remediation branch.
  - [ ] @buck TODO: anything (scenario: drift detection)
  - [ ] @buck raise XFailed("tacos/drift branch not created") branch?

## Misc. Action Items

This is the inbox during standup and weeklies.

- (none, currently)

## Maintainability

- [ ] @ellison user guide
  - how-to: avoid GHA notification spam
- [ ] @buck run tests in CI -- stretch
- convert the rest of the sh to python https://github.com/getsentry/tacos-gha
  - @ian: "I'll look and take some part of it"
  - use `./lib/git/ls-sh` for a listing
  - [ ] lib/ci/bin
  - [ ] lib/ci
  - [ ] lib/gcloud
  - [ ] lib/github_actions
  - [ ] lib/unix/super
  - [ ] lib/unix/quietly
  - [ ] lib/unix/tty-attach
- [ ] convert lib/tf-lock to use the (private!?) golang api
  - will need to fork terraform -- it's the only way to force un-private in go
  - this will help with several issues:
    - listing all locked slices efficiently
    - locking slices efficiently (don't need to kill -9 terraform-console)
    - retrieving lock info (don't need to parse `terraform force-unlock` errors)
    - setting lock info (no need for .github/actions/set-user-and-hostname)
- [x] @buck fix the test suite

k8s is able to manage VMs (and other non-k8s GCP objects) via "config connector"
gcloud components install config-connector

## Correctness

- [x] @ellison bug: committing to another persons's pr fails locking
- [x] refuse apply without review
  - [x] @buck apply should ignore approval by non-codeowners
    - i.e. check mergability instead of approvers
- [x] @ellison refuse apply for closed PR
  - [x] explain declined apply due to closed PR
    - suggest re-opening the PR
- [x] @ellison unlock even if closed by another user
  - set username from pr author on closed event
- [x] @buck P3: FIXME: tf-lock-info infinite regress if providers are undeclared

## Security

- [x] @buck security issue
  - [x] tf state lock auth -- @trostel has confirmed P2 priority
    - fixed: don't use the apply terraformer for the plan workflow
    - fixed: need a lower-privilege way to enable locking

## Ease of Use (UI/UX)

- [ ] @ellison Tell user that merge conflicts are preventing plan/apply
- [ ] on conflict, provide a link to conflicting PR
- [ ] @ellison user guide
- [ ] @ellison phased allowlist:
  1.  [x] off
  2.  [ ] plan-only
  3.  [ ] plan-and-lock
  4.  [x] plan-lock-apply
  5.  [ ] drift detection
- [ ] speed - minimize time to plan, round-trip
  - [ ] optimize setup action
  - [ ] optimize list-slices action
    - can we get just the filenames of _.hcl _.tf files?
    - then we can touch empty files, simulate a clone for
      determine-relevant-slices
  - [ ] leverage "narrow" git clones, where possible
- [ ] create, show plan even for "ready" PR that can't obtain lock
- [ ] @ian Node 16 deprecation warnings
  - https://github.com/getsentry/ops/actions/runs/7849633666
- [ ] @ian research: how to get the "job id" during a job?
  - it would be really good to leave a link to the job that produced the log
    shown in comment
- [x] explain declined apply due to draft status
- [x] explain declined apply due to missing review
- [x] @buck TODO: roll up "commands" in PR comments when exit code is 0
- [x] @buck TODO: roll up init / refresh phases from tf log

## Testing

### Tier 1

- [ ] terragrunt slice with dependencies
  - prevent regression: --terragrunt-no-auto-init was exploding during
    terragrunt-info
- [ ] run _something_ with debug mode active
- [ ] ensure below ‚ÄúTest Plan‚Äù is covered in automated tests
  - [x] create PR (‚ÄùPR1‚Äù) on one of the slices; see plan in comments
  - [ ] set `üåÆ:apply` label on PR; recieve error message about review
  - [ ] create PR on other (non-enabled) ops slices: nothing happens; close
  - [ ] create another, conflicting PR (‚ÄùPR2‚Äù)
  - [ ] see conflict error (with $USER@$PR) in comments
    - [ ] with link to conflicting PR
  - [ ] unlock PR1; update PR2; see PR2 take lock
  - [ ] merge PR2; label PR1 :taco::plan; see PR1 take lock
- [ ] raise XFailed("locking not yet implemented")
- [ ] raise XFailed("Comment not implemented yet.")
- [ ] explain declined apply due to closed PR

### Tier 2

- [ ] refuse apply without review
- [ ] p1: How does apply work in a auto-merge situation?
  - simple: complain if auto-merge is enabled for un-applied change
  - simple: user documentation? "dont do that"
  - is it possible to disable automerge in that case?
- [ ] set a terraformer at a repo-subpath .envrc
- [ ] demo four allowlist phases
- [ ] automated testing for lib/tf_lock -- see lib/tf_lock/TESTING.md
- [ ] raise XFailed("notify_owner action does not exist")
- [ ] raise XFailed("terraform changes not yet mergeable")
- [ ] FIXME: automated testing for lib/tf_lock
- [ ] sh.banner("TODO: check that the plan matches what we expect")

## Future Improvements

- [ ] TODO: fetch and apply the `--out tfplan` file from plan workflow
- [ ] TODO: github-script to fetch run-id of the most recent tfplan
- [ ] TODO: convert from matrix job to unlock slices "all at once"
- [ ] FIXME: use a more specific type than str
- [ ] TODO: workflow to automatically add taco:stale label as appropriate
- [ ] TODO: workflow to automatically add taco:abandoned label as appropriate
- [ ] integrate TACOS into terraform-sandbox repo:
      https://github.com/getsentry/terraform-sandboxes.private
  - this will help kickstart #proj-clickops

## Epics

- [ ] pip packaging
  - FIXME: we need pip packaging
- [ ] summary steps
  - FIXME: we need a fan-in summary
  - FIXME: this really should be done in a fan-in summary job
- [ ] TODO: interpolate with a python (rust?) script, for less abitrary
      execution

## Upstream

- def **init**( # pyright: ignore[reportMissingSuperCall] # TODO: bugreport
- upstream feature request on google-github-actions/auth -- this

## nice-to-have

AKA "probably not"

```
TODO: refactor to an object that takes token in constructor, remove autouse
TODO: update actions for minimal slice names
TODO: examine the expiry timestamp of the cached token
TODO: clean up `sac-terraformer` configs, then delete me:
TODO: clean up `sudo-gcp.toml` configs, then delete me:
TODO: amend if the previous commit was a similar auto-commit
```

## Long Term Goals

onboard preexisting users:

- getsentry/security-as-code
  - replace reusable-plan and reusable-apply with tacos-gha
  - ci, cd become callers to tacos-gha
- getsentry/security-fleetdm/.github/workflow/{ci,cd}
- getsentry/terraform-sandbox/.github/workflow/{ci,cd}
- getsentry/eng-pipes
- getsentry/devenv-deployment-service
