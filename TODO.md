# TODO

## 2014-03-13

- ending phase 1

  - combined messages, like plan
    - @neo unlock
    - @neo apply
  - @ellison fix test suite -- update to new tag style, used in combined plan
    summary
  - @buck datadog ops events
    - remove the `if-not-ci` wrapper and it _may_ just work?
      `git grep if-not-ci`
  - run test suite in CI
    - put op github-app secrets into gha secrets
    - may need some security-as-code stuff to authorize gcloud?

## Misc. Action Items

This is the inbox during standup and weeklies.

An inbox for quick use during meetings:

- [ ] P2/3 lock and plan downstream terragrunt dependencies too? needs more
      discussion
- UI enhancement requests:
  - [ ] Make it much more clear that the lock was taken
  - [ ] Make it clear why the lock was taken
  - [ ] Leave a breadcrumb to User's Guide
- [ ] TSC presentatino about IAM long-term

## Major Milestones

P1

### M3 Wide Rollout

Definition: All ops slices are subject to TACOS lock-on-PR.

- commitment: 2024-03-06
- goal: 2024-02-28
- assignees: buck ellison neo

* [ ] wide rollout & comms -- use TACOS by default for all ops slices

  - [ ] set an "unlock in progress" message in the PR (use the mode:delete
        option) #good-first-pr
        https://github.com/thollander/actions-comment-pull-request?tab=readme-ov-file#delete-a-comment
    - [ ] similarly, for plan
    - [ ] similarly, for apply
  - [ ] :tacos::unlock should not cancel convert-to-draft
    - remove :tacos::unlock in favor of convert-to-draft
    - deprecation phase: post a PR comment about "convert to draft instead"
  - [~] @buck combined summary comments
    - simple version: concatenate
    - FIXME: we need a fan-in summary
    - FIXME: this really should be done in a fan-in summary job
    - [ ] fan-in summary for the tacos_unlock workflow
  - [x] @jim ops fixes to project & bucket permissions
    - https://getsentry.atlassian.net/browse/OPS-5203
  - done:
    - [x] @ellison Tell user that merge conflicts are preventing plan/apply
    - [x] @ellison JIRA backlog to tf-import test-region bucket IAM
      - gs://sentry-test-region-terraform
      - https://getsentry.atlassian.net/browse/OPS-5244
    - [x] @ellison clickops quickfix test-region bucket
      - https://gist.github.com/bukzor/ee00a6f75d4a0cc7f865c37cfa67a895

### M4 Drift Remediation

Definition: All ops slices are subject to TACOS lock-on-drift.

- commitment: 2024-03-13
- goal: 2024-03-06
- assignees: buck ellison neo

* [ ] drift remediation

  - [?] @ellison phased allowlist:
    https://github.com/getsentry/tacos-gha/pull/119
    1.  [x] off
    2.  ~[wontfix] plan-only~
    3.  [ ] plan-and-lock
    4.  [x] plan-lock-apply
    5.  [ ] drift detection
  - [~] @neo ensure lock conflict message links to the lock-holding PR
    - essential for people know when there's conflicting drift
    - i.e. Ensure there's a good, human-readable PR message for unlock failure
  - [ ] @buck raise XFailed("tacos/drift branch not created") branch?
  - [ ] @buck TODO: check for the opening of the drift remediation branch.
  - [ ] @buck TODO: anything (scenario: drift detection)

later, after full rollout and acceptance

- [ ] @ellison down the old terraform-plan workflow
- [x?] how will people know when there's _new_ drift?
  - will need to reconsider once we have more user experience
  - initial implementation: people need to notice the automatic drift pr
  - slack notification?
  - team-sre needs to decide

## Maintainability

P2

### M5 into Maintenance Mode

Definition: All tacos-gha work beyond this milestone work is optional and can be
done on a 20%-time basis. (To be clear, this milestone is non-optional.)

- commitment: 2024-04-03
- goal: 2024-03-20
- assignees @50% time: buck ellison neo?

- [ ] ownership/stewardship transition
  - [ ] @ellison developer's guide
    - HACKING.md ?
  - [ ] onboard a new team member from SRE
    - neo dmitrii jim richard
    - [x] invite to standup
- [~] @ellison user guide
  - how-to: avoid GHA notification spam
  - https://github.com/getsentry/tacos-gha/pull/168
- [ ] @buck run tests in CI -- stretch
- [ ] convert the rest of the sh to python
      https://github.com/getsentry/tacos-gha
  - @ian: "I'll look and take some part of it"
  - use `./lib/git/ls-sh` for a listing
  - [ ] lib/ci/bin
  - [ ] lib/ci
  - [ ] lib/gcloud
  - [ ] lib/github_actions
  - [ ] lib/unix/super
  - [ ] lib/unix/quietly
  - [ ] lib/unix/tty-attach
- [x] @buck get the test suite passing

k8s is able to manage VMs (and other non-k8s GCP objects) via "config connector"
gcloud components install config-connector

## Correctness

P1

- [x] @ellison bug: committing to another persons's pr fails locking
- [x] refuse apply without review
  - [x] @buck apply should ignore approval by non-codeowners
    - i.e. check mergability instead of approvers
- [x] @ellison refuse apply for closed PR
  - [x] explain declined apply due to closed PR
    - suggest re-opening the PR
- [x] @ellison unlock even if closed by another user
  - set username from pr author on closed event
- [x] @buck P3: FIXME: tf-lock-info infinite regress if providers are undeclared

## Security

- [x] @buck security issue
  - [x] tf state lock auth -- @trostel has confirmed P2 priority
    - fixed: don't use the apply terraformer for the plan workflow
    - fixed: need a lower-privilege way to enable locking

## Ease of Use (UI/UX)

P2

- [ ] on conflict, provide a link to conflicting PR
- [ ] speed - minimize time to plan, round-trip
  - [ ] optimize setup action
  - [ ] optimize list-slices action
    - can we get just the filenames of _.hcl _.tf files?
    - then we can touch empty files, simulate a clone for
      determine-relevant-slices
  - [ ] leverage "narrow" git clones, where possible
- [ ] create, show plan even for "ready" PR that can't obtain lock
- [ ] P3 @ian Node 16 deprecation warnings
  - https://github.com/getsentry/ops/actions/runs/7849633666
- [ ] leave a link to the job that produced the log shown in comment
  - example:
    https://github.com/getsentry/tacos-gha/actions/runs/7890053512/job/21531390874
    https://github.com/$org/$repo/actions/runs/$runid/job/$jobid
  - [ ] @ian research: how to get the "job id" during a job?
- [x] explain declined apply due to draft status
- [x] explain declined apply due to missing review
- [x] @buck TODO: roll up "commands" in PR comments when exit code is 0
- [x] @buck TODO: roll up init / refresh phases from tf log

## Testing

### Tier 1

P2

- [ ] terragrunt slice with dependencies
  - prevent regression: --terragrunt-no-auto-init was exploding during
    terragrunt-info
- [ ] run _something_ with debug mode active
- [ ] ensure below ‚ÄúTest Plan‚Äù is covered in automated tests
  - [x] create PR (‚ÄùPR1‚Äù) on one of the slices; see plan in comments
  - [ ] set `üåÆ:apply` label on PR; recieve error message about review
  - [ ] create PR on other (non-enabled) ops slices: nothing happens; close
  - [ ] create another, conflicting PR (‚ÄùPR2‚Äù)
  - [ ] see conflict error (with $USER@$PR) in comments
    - [ ] with link to conflicting PR
  - [ ] unlock PR1; update PR2; see PR2 take lock
  - [ ] merge PR2; label PR1 :taco::plan; see PR1 take lock
- [ ] raise XFailed("locking not yet implemented")
- [ ] raise XFailed("Comment not implemented yet.")
- [ ] explain declined apply due to closed PR

### Tier 2

- [ ] refuse apply without review
- [ ] p1: How does apply work in a auto-merge situation?
  - simple: complain if auto-merge is enabled for un-applied change
  - simple: user documentation? "dont do that"
  - is it possible to disable automerge in that case?
- [ ] set a terraformer at a repo-subpath .envrc
- [ ] demo four allowlist phases
- [ ] automated testing for lib/tf_lock -- see lib/tf_lock/TESTING.md
- [ ] raise XFailed("notify_owner action does not exist")
- [ ] raise XFailed("terraform changes not yet mergeable")
- [ ] FIXME: automated testing for lib/tf_lock
- [ ] sh.banner("TODO: check that the plan matches what we expect")

## Future Improvements

These may never happen, but that's okay.

- [ ] TODO: fetch and apply the `--out tfplan` file from plan workflow
- [ ] TODO: github-script to fetch run-id of the most recent tfplan
- [ ] TODO: convert from matrix job to unlock slices "all at once"
- [ ] FIXME: use a more specific type than str
- [ ] TODO: workflow to automatically add taco:stale label as appropriate
- [ ] TODO: workflow to automatically add taco:abandoned label as appropriate
- [ ] integrate TACOS into terraform-sandbox repo:
      https://github.com/getsentry/terraform-sandboxes.private
  - this will help kickstart #proj-clickops
- [ ] convert lib/tf-lock to use the (private!?) golang api
  - will need to fork terraform -- it's the only way to force un-private in go
  - this will help with several issues:
    - listing all locked slices efficiently
    - locking slices efficiently (don't need to kill -9 terraform-console)
    - retrieving lock info (don't need to parse `terraform force-unlock` errors)
    - setting lock info (no need for .github/actions/set-user-and-hostname)

## Epics

- [ ] pip packaging
  - FIXME: we need pip packaging
- [ ] TODO: interpolate with a python (rust?) script, for less abitrary
      execution

## Upstream

- def **init**( # pyright: ignore[reportMissingSuperCall] # TODO: bugreport
- upstream feature request on google-github-actions/auth -- this

## nice-to-have

AKA "probably not"

```
TODO: refactor to an object that takes token in constructor, remove autouse
TODO: update actions for minimal slice names
TODO: examine the expiry timestamp of the cached token
TODO: clean up `sac-terraformer` configs, then delete me:
TODO: clean up `sudo-gcp.toml` configs, then delete me:
TODO: amend if the previous commit was a similar auto-commit
```

## Long Term Goals

onboard preexisting users:

- getsentry/security-as-code
  - replace reusable-plan and reusable-apply with tacos-gha
  - ci, cd become callers to tacos-gha
- getsentry/security-fleetdm/.github/workflow/{ci,cd}
- getsentry/terraform-sandbox/.github/workflow/{ci,cd}
- getsentry/eng-pipes
- getsentry/devenv-deployment-service
